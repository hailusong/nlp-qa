Here is our updated policy at Clear Living Clinic to keep you safe and provide peace-of-mind. We will be limiting the number of clients in the clinic at all times. We will be allowing only one client at a time in the waiting area. Non-clients will be asked to kindly wait outside the clinic if someone is accompanying you to your appointment. Upon booking an appointment, we will pre-screen every client before they are permitted to visit the clinic. If you have traveled recently, feel under the weather or are taking care of someone who is ill, please call your family doctor or Telehealth Ontario and self-isolate for 14 days. 
Check-in: Please wash your hands upon arrival. As usual, we provide you with hand sanitizer and paper towels. We will also provide you with disposable gloves, a mask and a disposable toilet seat cover upon request. Our clinic has always been very proactive with disinfecting all surfaces using hospital grade disinfectant before and after each client. We are adding even more diligence to these protocols. We highly recommend everyone to wear a mask or some form of face covering. We can provide you with a mask if you donâ€™t have one. Our therapists will be wearing a mask or face-shield. Social distancing guidelines will be honored between staff and clients. With our Angel of Water colonic equipment, social distancing is easy.
